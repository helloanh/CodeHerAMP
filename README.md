# CodeHerAMP

In the era of mobile web, speed and performance are critical. Today the mobile experience can be frustrating, punctuated with interrupted service, slow networks, and ads that take a minute to load. Most users abandon a page if it does not load within 3 seconds. In my session I’ll introduce attendees to Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) – a web component library as well as a broader philosophy for mobile web. AMP uses multiple strategies – pre-loading, caching, async scripts, restrictions on CSS and non-performant code – to achieve a near-instantaneous load of content. Using starter templates, the workshop attendees will walk away with a fully functional AMP page and the knowledge needed to continue creating fast-loading pages.
